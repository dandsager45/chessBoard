TODO

1)Create Bitboard
	Determine Languague being used -> python for Neural Net libraries? C/C++ for speed? Hybrid?

	Create schema on how to represent data
	
	Temp: Create a visualization function -print
	Final: integrate with a COTS/FOSS chess GUI (or go 1 step further and create my own visualization GUI for fun)
	
	
	Create Implementation of Chess pieces, legal moves
	
	Don't forget about "special case states - En Passant / Castling
	
	Create list of potential "Canditate Moves" 
		Don't forget to remove moves which are not legal (discovered check)
		
	Unit Test Framework?
	
	Add in a "play against the engine" framework
	
	
2)Simple Evaluation Function

	Start extremely simple, minimax w/ just piece point evaluation
	Continue to add in additional features, alpha beta pruning, negimax, etc.
	
	Try out different engines vs each other and keep a scoreboard
	
	
3) Machine Learning

	Will do more research here once I have gotten a basic eval function completed
